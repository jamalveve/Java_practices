Java String
In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. An array of characters works same as Java string. For example:

char[] ch={'j','a','v','a','t','p','o','i','n','t'};  
String s=new String(ch);  
is same as:

String s="javatpoint";  
ava String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on strings such as compare(), concat(), equals(), split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.
 But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. 
 The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.

 Why Java uses the concept of String literal?
To make Java more memory efficient
 (because no new objects are created if it exists already in the string constant pool).
 ->Why String class is Final in Java?
The reason behind the String class being final is because no one can override the methods of the String class. So that it can provide the same features to the new String objects as well as to the old ones.
