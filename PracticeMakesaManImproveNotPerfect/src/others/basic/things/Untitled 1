1)variables and methods
***********************
variable
^^^^^^^^^^
  ->local varivale and global variables
  ->non statuc ave to  create onject and call
  ->static classsname.vafiablename
  ->local variable must be ijnitialised and only final local variable is allowed
  ->inside non static method you can access both static and non static variables
  ->but inside static method you can access only static variables'
  ->any final vafrible whicg is local or global cant be modfied.
  ->if we cret=ate a obj n another class by above ways we can access variables
  
 Methods
 ^^^^^^^^^
 ->non static and static methods
 _>non static object createvhave to do
 ->static classsname.methodname
 ->final methods cant be overided 
 ->final method can be called from any class inside the same package(package private)
 
if else
**************

loops
Arrays'
Strings
**********
string builder
String Buffer


comparator/comparable
***********************


2)static blocks
*************
->invoke in constructor and class as well
->runs before main method
->more than one satic block we can keep in the class or constructor
->cant call nonstatic methods inside static block
-> A static block is not called by you or any other part of your code,
 it's automatically called by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when the class is loaded.
 ->The static block for a class gets executed when the class is accessed ,to create an instance,

3)marker interface
*******************
4)spilterator/iterator
*************************

5)serialization/deserialization
****************************

method and constructor chaining->

 
double braces/anonymous inner class

doubts
******
1)method hiding
2)method chaining
3)return this();
